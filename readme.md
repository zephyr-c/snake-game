<h1>It's Snake!</h1>
<p> Who doesn't remember the classic snake game from the calculators and brick phones of the past?</p>
<p> This a snake game that I built in Python using the Turtle Graphics module. Control the snake using your up, 
down, left, and right arrows. Snatch up the little food balls by directing your snake over them and watch your score go up! 
But be careful! If you hit a wall or your tail it's game over!</p>
<p>This game requires Python3 to run, so you'll want to have that installed.</p>
<p>Just run the main.py file after cloning and you'll be on your way! The snake starts moving immediately once the 
window opens, so be ready! </p>
